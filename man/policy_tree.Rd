\title{Fit a policy with exact tree search}
\usage{
policy_tree(X, Gamma, depth = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{The covariates used. Dimension \eqn{Np} where \eqn{p} is the number of features.}

\item{Gamma}{The rewards for each action. Dimension \eqn{Nd} where \eqn{d} is the number of actions.}

\item{depth}{The depth of the fitted tree. Default is 2.}
}
\value{
A policy_tree object.
}
\description{
Finds the optimal (maximizing the sum of rewards) depth L tree by exhaustive search. If the optimal
action is the same in both the left and right leaf of a node, the node is pruned.
