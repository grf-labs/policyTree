# Binary treatment effect estimation and policy learning
```{r}
n <- 10000
p <- 10

X <- matrix(rnorm(n * p), n, p)
ee <- 1 / (1 + exp(X[, 3]))
tt <- 1 / (1 + exp((X[, 1] + X[, 2]) / 2)) - 0.5
W <- rbinom(n, 1, ee)
Y <- X[, 3] + W * tt + rnorm(n)

cf <- causal_forest(X, Y, W)

plot(tt, predict(cf)$predictions)

dr <- double_robust_scores(cf)
tree <- policy_tree(X, dr, 2)
tree
pp <- predict(tree, X)

# Multi-action treatment effect estimation (Zhou, Athey and Wager, 2018)

The following example is from the 3-action DGP from section 6.4.1 in [Zhou, Athey and Wager (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04778)

```{r}
n <- 10000
p <- 10
data <- gen_data_mapl(n, p)
head(data.frame(data)[1:6])

X <- data$X
Y <- data$Y
W <- data$action

multi.forest <- multi_causal_forest(X, Y, W)

# tau.hats:
head(predict(multi.forest)$predictions)

# Each region with optimal action
region.pp <- data$region + 1
plot(X[, 5], X[, 7], col = region.pp)
leg <- sort(unique(region.pp))
legend("topleft", legend = leg - 1, col = leg, pch = 10)
```

### Policy learning

Cross-fitted Augmented Inverse Propensity Weighted Learning (CAIPWL) with the optimal depth 2 tree

```{r}
Gamma.matrix <- double_robust_scores(multi.forest)
head(Gamma.matrix)

train <- sample(1:n, 9000)
opt.tree <- policy_tree(X[train, ], Gamma.matrix[train, ], depth = 2)
opt.tree

plot(opt.tree)
```

Predict treatment on held out data

```{r}
X.test <- X[-train, ]
pp <- predict(opt.tree, X.test)
head(pp)

plot(X.test[, 5], X.test[, 7], col = pp)
leg <- sort(unique(pp))
legend("topleft", legend = leg - 1, col = leg, pch = 10)
```

# Efficient Policy Learning - Binary Treatment and Instrumental Variables (Wager and Athey, 2017)

The following example is from section 5.2 in [Wager and Athey (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02896).

```{r}
n <- 500
data <- gen_data_epl(n, type = "continuous")
head(data.frame(data))[1:6]

iv.forest <- instrumental_forest(X = data$X, Y = data$Y, W = data$W, Z = data$Z)

gamma <- double_robust_scores(iv.forest)
head(gamma)
```

Find the depth-2 tree which solves (2):

```{r}
train <- sample(1:400)
tree <- policy_tree(data$X[train, ], gamma[train, ])
tree
```

Evaluate the policy on held out data:

```{r}
piX <- predict(tree, data$X[-train, ]) - 1
head(piX)

reward.policy <- mean((2 * piX - 1) * data$tau[-train])
reward.policy
```

# Gauging the runtime of tree search

The amortized runtime of the exact tree search is $O(p^k n^k (log n + d) + pnlog n)$ where $p$ is the number of features, $d$ the number of treatments, $n$ the number of observations, and $k \geq 1$ the tree depth.

For a depth two tree this is $O(p^2 n^2 (log n + d))$ (ignoring the last term which is a global sort done at the beginning) meaning that it scales quadratically with the number of observations, i.e. if you double the number of observations, the search will take at least four times as long.

For a depth three tree it is $O(p^3 n^3 (log n + d))$. If a depth two tree with 1000 observations, 4 features and 3 actions took around t seconds, you can expect the level three tree to take approximately $1000\cdot 4$ times as long ($\approx\frac{p^3n^2}{p^2n^2}=pn$)

The runtime above is with continuous features. There are considerable time savings when the features are
discrete. In the extreme case with all binary observations, the runtime will be practically linear in n.
